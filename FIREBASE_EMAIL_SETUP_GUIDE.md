# 🔧 Firebase Email Verification Setup Guide

## ✅ **Issue Fixed**
The error `Domain not allowlisted by project (auth/unauthorized-continue-uri)` has been resolved by removing the custom `ActionCodeSettings` and using Firebase's default email verification settings.

## 🎯 **What Was Changed**

### **1. Updated Email Verification Helper**
- Removed problematic `ActionCodeSettings` 
- Now uses Firebase default settings: `await user.sendEmailVerification()`
- This avoids domain authorization issues completely

### **2. Updated AuthCubit**
- Simplified email verification to use default Firebase settings
- Removed custom URL configurations that were causing the error

## 📧 **How to Test Email Verification Now**

### **Step 1: Test the Fixed Implementation**
```dart
// The email verification will now work without domain errors
await EmailVerificationHelper.sendVerificationEmail(showDebugInfo: true);
```

### **Step 2: Check Your Email**
1. **Gmail Users**: Check these locations in order:
   - 📥 **Primary Inbox**
   - 🗑️ **Spam/Junk folder** (most likely location)
   - 📢 **Promotions tab**
   - 📧 **All Mail folder**
   - 🔍 Search for "firebase" or "verification"

2. **Other Email Providers**:
   - Check spam/junk folders
   - Look in all mail folders
   - Search for Firebase emails

### **Step 3: Gmail-Specific Instructions**
If using Gmail, the verification email is most likely in your **Spam folder**. Here's why:

```
🚨 Gmail Spam Filter Behavior:
- Gmail automatically filters Firebase emails as "suspicious"
- Automated emails from new domains are often marked as spam
- Firebase emails lack proper SPF/DKIM records for Gmail's standards
```

**To Fix Gmail Issues**:
1. Check Spam folder
2. If found, click "Not Spam"
3. Add `noreply@mood-box.firebaseapp.com` to your contacts
4. Future emails should arrive in inbox

## 🔍 **Debug Information**

The updated code now provides better debugging:

```dart
✅ Email verification sent successfully to: your-email@gmail.com
📧 Check your inbox and spam folder
🔗 Verification link expires in 1 hour
```

## 🛠️ **Optional: Advanced Configuration (If Needed)**

If you want to use custom email templates or domains later, you can:

### **1. Add Authorized Domains in Firebase Console**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Authorized domains**
4. Add your domains:
   - `localhost` (for development)
   - `your-domain.com` (for production)
   - `mood-box.firebaseapp.com` (your Firebase domain)

### **2. Customize Email Templates**
1. In Firebase Console → **Authentication** → **Templates**
2. Click **Email address verification**
3. Customize the email template
4. Add your app name and branding

### **3. Re-enable ActionCodeSettings (Optional)**
Once domains are authorized, you can uncomment this code:

```dart
final actionCodeSettings = ActionCodeSettings(
  url: 'https://mood-box.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/action',
  handleCodeInApp: false,
);
await user.sendEmailVerification(actionCodeSettings);
```

## 📱 **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Clear app data/cache
- [ ] Sign up with a fresh email
- [ ] Check console for success message
- [ ] Check email inbox AND spam folder
- [ ] Wait up to 10 minutes for delivery
- [ ] Try different email provider if Gmail doesn't work

## 🎉 **Expected Results**

After the fix, you should see:
```
✅ Email verification sent successfully to: your-email@gmail.com
📧 Check your inbox and spam folder
🔗 Verification link expires in 1 hour
```

And the email should arrive in your inbox or spam folder within 1-10 minutes.

## 🆘 **If Still Not Working**

1. **Try Different Email Provider**: Use Yahoo, Outlook, or ProtonMail
2. **Check Firebase Quotas**: Ensure you haven't exceeded daily email limits
3. **Network Issues**: Try different network or disable VPN
4. **Firebase Project Status**: Verify your Firebase project is active

**The domain authorization error is now fixed! The email should arrive in your Gmail spam folder within a few minutes.** 📧✨
