# 🔧 Fix GitHub Pages Deployment

## 🚨 Current Problem
Your GitHub Pages is showing README.md instead of the Flutter app because:
1. Flutter web files are not built and deployed
2. GitHub Pages needs the built web files, not the source code

## ✅ Solution Steps

### Step 1: Build Flutter Web App
```bash
# Enable web support
flutter config --enable-web

# Clean and get dependencies
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Build for GitHub Pages with correct base href
flutter build web --release --web-renderer html --base-href /Mood-Box-/
```

### Step 2: Deploy Built Files
You have 2 options:

#### Option A: Automatic with GitHub Actions (Recommended)
1. Just push your current code to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

2. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build the Flutter web app
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Your app will be live at: https://dewahdafahmank.github.io/Mood-Box-/

#### Option B: Manual Deployment
1. Build the app locally:
```bash
./build_and_deploy.sh
```

2. Copy all files from `build/web/` to a new branch called `gh-pages`
3. Push the `gh-pages` branch to GitHub
4. Set GitHub Pages to use `gh-pages` branch

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll to "Pages" section
3. Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select "gh-pages" branch (if using manual) or keep "GitHub Actions"

## 🌐 Expected Result

After deployment, your app will be live at:
**https://dewahdafahmank.github.io/Mood-Box-/**

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

Check these URLs:
- Main app: https://dewahdafahmank.github.io/Mood-Box-/
- Assets: https://dewahdafahmank.github.io/Mood-Box-/assets/
- Flutter files: https://dewahdafahmank.github.io/Mood-Box-/main.dart.js

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you see blank page:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify base href is correct: `/Mood-Box-/`
3. Check if all assets are loading

### If GitHub Actions fails:
1. Check Actions tab in your repository
2. Look for error messages in the logs
3. Ensure Flutter version is compatible

### If app doesn't load:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check if Firebase configuration is correct
3. Verify API keys are not exposed in public code

## 🚀 Quick Fix Command

Run this single command to fix everything:
```bash
# Make script executable and run
chmod +x build_and_deploy.sh
./build_and_deploy.sh

# Then push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Flutter web app"
git push origin main
```
